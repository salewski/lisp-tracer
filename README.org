* Lisp tracer
A ray tracer made in Common Lisp following [[https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge][The Ray Tracer Challenge]] by
Jamis Buck

** Example
[[./pictures/fresnel.png]]
** How to run
You need to enable double floats. We need the higher precision to avoid
acne.
#+begin_src lisp
  (setf *read-default-float-format* 'double-float)
#+end_src

Then evaluate =lisp-tracer.asd= and go to the corresponding =lisp-tracer=
package in the REPL. The renders can be found in =src/renders=, and will create
a =picture.ppm= in root.

** Tests
You can run tests by evaluating =lisp-tracer-tests.asd=, then running
#+begin_src lisp
  (run :lisp-tracer-tests :style :spec)
#+end_src
from  =lisp-tracer-tests= package.
